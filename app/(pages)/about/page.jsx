            I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer
            Science and Engineering from the American International
            University-Bangladesh. I have a strong background in programming and
            web development, specializing in Angular and ASP.NET Core, and I'm
            proficient in Java, Python, C and C++. During my internships, I gained
            valuable experience in project research, planning, and working
            directly with clients. I've also been recognized for my achievements
            in cybersecurity challenges, particularly in hacking competitions.
            I'm excited to bring my skills to a dynamic and innovative
            environment where I can contribute to meaningful projects and
            continue to grow professionally.
